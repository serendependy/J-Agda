J-Agda
=======================================

Not as exciting as it sounds. I plan on using this to make a Scala or Idris
project.

Both J and Agda are obscure functional languages. J introduced to the world
the concept of "function rank", which allows you to specify function
application over arbitrary subcollections of regular collections. Sadly, J is
dynamically typed (and also hard to read - it's called a ``write-only'' 
language). Fully capturing the kinds of shape transformations going on requires
a dependently typed programming language.
